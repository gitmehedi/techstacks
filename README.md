    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the term used to describe a programming approach based on objects and classes.</strong>

# Introduction
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that methods are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields.


# Pillars of OOPs
The major concepts that we have discussed above are known as pillars of OOPs. There are four pillars on which OOP rests.

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Details of are given below
## Abstraction
## Encapsulation
The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit is known as encapsulation. It is also known as information hiding concept.


## Inheritance
## Polymorph

# SOLID Principle
SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin
SOLID stands for:
- S - Single-responsiblity Principle
- O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single-Responsibility Principle
Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.


## Open-Closed Principle
Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:

> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.


## Liskov Substitution Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle states:

> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.


## Interface Segregation Principle
Interface segregation principle states:

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.


## Dependency Inversion Principle
Dependency inversion principle states:
> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

# Agile and Scrum

## Introduction

Scrum Alliance is the oldest non-profit membership organization for Scrum,
and that supports the adoption and effective use of Scrum. The three most
prominent offerings of the Scrum Alliance are

### What is Agile?

Agile is a mindset

- A mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notions held by one or more people or group of people.
- A mental inclination or disposition

**__Being Agile Over Doing Agile__**

* Agile is NOT a process
* Agile is NOT a framework
* Agile is NOT a methodology

To understand above state you need to understand following terms

## Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

| First Value                  | over | Second Value                |   
|------------------------------|------|-----------------------------|
| Individuals and interactions | OVER | processes and tools         |
| Working software             | OVER | comprehensive documentation |
| Customer collaboration       | OVER | contract negotiation        |
| Responding to change         | OVER | following a plan            |

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Agile Principles

| # | Principal                                                                                                                                     |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.                                   |
| 2 | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.             |
| 3 | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.                |
| 4 | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.                                                               |
| 5 | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment andsupport they need, and trust them to get the job done.              |
| 6 | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-faceconversation.                |
| 7 | Working software is the primary measure of progress.                                                                                          |
| 8 | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. |
| 9 | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.                                                                |
| 10 | Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.                                                                  |
| 11 | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.                                                          |
| 12 | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.                     |

## Agile Frameworks

Agile, an iterative and incremental methods
|Method|Description|
|-----|------|
| Incremental | This is a development approach that slices the system functionality into increments (portions). |
|Iterative|This is a development approach that breaks the process of developing a large product into smaller parts. Each part, called “iteration”, represents the whole development process and contains planning, design, development, and testing steps.|

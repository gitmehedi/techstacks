# Agile 

## Introduction

Scrum Alliance is the oldest non-profit membership organization for Scrum,
and that supports the adoption and effective use of Scrum. The three most
prominent offerings of the Scrum Alliance are

### What is Agile?

Agile is a mindset

- A mindset is a set of assumptions, methods, or notions held by one or more people or group of people.
- A mental inclination or disposition

**__Being Agile Over Doing Agile__**

## Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

| First Value                  | over | Second Value                |   
|------------------------------|------|-----------------------------|
| Individuals and interactions | OVER | processes and tools         |
| Working software             | OVER | comprehensive documentation |
| Customer collaboration       | OVER | contract negotiation        |
| Responding to change         | OVER | following a plan            |

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Agile Principles

| # | Principal                                                                                                                                     |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.                                   |
| 2 | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.             |
| 3 | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.                |
| 4 | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.                                                               |
| 5 | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment andsupport they need, and trust them to get the job done.              |
| 6 | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-faceconversation.                |
| 7 | Working software is the primary measure of progress.                                                                                          |
| 8 | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. |
| 9 | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.                                                                |
| 10 | Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.                                                                  |
| 11 | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.                                                          |
| 12 | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.                     |

## Agile Frameworks

**Agile frameworks use Incremental & Iterative approaches together.**  
The idea is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller
portions at a time (incremental), allowing developers to take advantage of what
was learnt during development of earlier parts or versions of the system.

Incremental and Iterative approach describe as

|Method|Description|
|-----|--------|
| Incremental | This is a development approach that slices the system functionality into increments (portions). |
| Iterative | This is a development approach that breaks the process of developing a large product into smaller parts. Each part, called “iteration”, represents the whole development process and contains planning, design, development, and testing steps.|

Main characteristics of Agile Framework

* Collaboration
* Communication
* Focus on Quality
* Discipline
* Eliminate State
* Team Work - no hero
* Short Feedback Loops
* Lots of Planning

Popular agile framework used for which used for various domain and complexity

<img src="img/agile_methodology.png" alt="Agile Methodology"/>

### Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which people can address
complex adaptive problems, while productively and
creatively delivering products of the highest possible
value.
A simple framework for effective team collaboration on
complex products.

### Kanban

Kanban is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage
work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.

### Extreme Programming (XP)

XP is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and
responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

### Crystal

Crystal allows teams to work the way they deem most effective.

Based on:

- Human-powered
- Adaptive
- Ultra-light

### FDD

Feature Drive Development (FDD) is customer-centric, iterative, and incremental, with the goal of 
delivering tangible software results often and efficiently

There are lots of framework available depending on agile mindset.

## Empiricism

There are two main process available

### Empirical Process

An empirical process is implemented where progress is based on observation and experimentation instead of
detailed, upfront planning and defined processes. Using empirical process control is working in a fact-based,
experience-based, and evidence-based manner,
not fictitious plans.

### Defined Process

A defined process is one with a set of steps that should
produce the same output every time within a defined
variance range, given the same inputs.

Scrum is based on Empirical Process Control

<img src="img/defined_process.png" alt="Defined Process"/>

**Three Pillars of Empirical Process Control**

#### Transparency

The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the
work as well as those receiving the work.

Transparency enables Inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

#### Inspection

Progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.

Inspection enables Adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless.

#### Adaptation

If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is
unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted.

Adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

##### Evolutionary Product Planning
<img src="img/product_planning.png" height="400" width="830" alt="Product Planning">

**Traditional Fixed Planning Versus Evolutionary Product Planning**  
Evolutionary product planning in an empirical environment differs from traditional fixed planning in the following ways:
- Processes are not repeatable, are visible, and promote inspection and adaptation.
- Work/process steps may not be understood.
- Impacted by factors such as past performance and capacity differences.
- Improvement and direction guided by experiments and experience.

# Scrum
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations
generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. The Scrum framework is immutable. 
While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. 
Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and
practices.

- Scrum is an Agile framework for completing complex projects.
- Scrum originally was formalized for software development projects, but it works well for any complex, innovative scope of work. The
possibilities are endless. The Scrum framework is deceptively simple.
- An Iterative and Incremental method from Agile Family

<img src="img/scrum_process.jpg" alt="Scrum Process">

Main scrum characteristics
- Simple.
- Purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Empiricism and Lean thinking.
- Built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it.
- Wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary.

History
- Since early 1990s.
- First time presented in 1995.
- Latest update in Nov 2020.

## Scrum Values

<h4 stype="color:red;">Scrum Framework is recommended as 3-5-3</h4>




















## Scrum Disadvantages
- It’s hard!
- Makes all dysfunction visible
- Scrum doesn’t fix anything: the team has to do it
- Feels like things are worse at the beginning
- Bad products will be delivered sooner, and doomed projects will fail faster
- Some teams and organizations are not right or ready for it
- Team willingness, capabilities
- Management buy-in
- Risk of turnover during adoption
- Some people will refuse to stay on a Scrum team
- Some people will refuse to stay if Scrum is abandoned
- Partial adoption may be worse than none at all
- If adoption fails, time will have been wasted, and some people may leave
